# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Implementing the parallel processing logic in the `CardPinProcessingService`.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Created the data models (Card, Pin, DTOs).
*   Defined the repository interfaces.
*   Configured the Spring Boot project.

**Next Steps:**

*   Develop the `ExternalApiClient` to communicate with the `Unified API Service`.
*   Implement the `CardPinProcessingService` to orchestrate the parallel processing.
*   Implement RequestId for Processing Service

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

*   Determining the optimal thread pool size for the `ExecutorService`.
*   Choosing between WebClient and RestTemplate for the `ExternalApiClient`.
*   Defining the API contract between the `Processing Service` and the `Unified API Service`.
