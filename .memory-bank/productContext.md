# Product Context

**Problem:** The current system processes Card and PIN objects sequentially, leading to performance bottlenecks when dealing with large volumes of data.

**Solution:** This project introduces parallel processing to improve efficiency and reduce processing time.

**How it should work:** The Processing Service will receive a mixed list of Card and PIN objects, split them into separate lists, and process them concurrently using an ExecutorService and CompletableFutures. A Unified API Service will provide a single endpoint for status checks, and the Processing Service will update a local database with the results.

**User Experience Goals:**

*   Reduced processing time for Card and PIN objects.
*   Improved system responsiveness.
*   Reliable and accurate data processing.
